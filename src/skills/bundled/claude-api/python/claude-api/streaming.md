# Streaming Messages

---

When creating a Message, you can set `"stream": true` to incrementally stream the response using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents) (SSE).

## Streaming with SDKs

The [Python](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript) SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The [PHP](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-php) SDK provides streaming via `createStream()`. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();

await client.messages
  .stream({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
    model: "claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens: 1024
  })
  .on("text", (text) => {
    console.log(text);
  });
```

```go Go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go"
)

func main() {
	client := anthropic.NewClient()

	stream := client.Messages.NewStreaming(context.TODO(), anthropic.MessageNewParams{
		Model:     anthropic.ModelClaudeOpus4_6,
		MaxTokens: 1024,
		Messages: []anthropic.MessageParam{
			anthropic.NewUserMessage(anthropic.NewTextBlock("Hello")),
		},
	})

	for stream.Next() {
		event := stream.Current()
		switch eventVariant := event.AsAny().(type) {
		case anthropic.ContentBlockDeltaEvent:
			switch deltaVariant := eventVariant.Delta.AsAny().(type) {
			case anthropic.TextDelta:
				fmt.Print(deltaVariant.Text)
			}
		}
	}
	if err := stream.Err(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

## Get the final message without handling events

If you don't need to process text as it arrives, the SDKs provide a way to use streaming under the hood while returning the complete `Message` object, identical to what `.create()` returns. This is especially useful for requests with large `max_tokens` values, where the SDKs require streaming to avoid HTTP timeouts.

```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    max_tokens=128000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a detailed analysis..."}],
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
) as stream:
    message = stream.get_final_message()

print(message.content[0].text)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();

const stream = client.messages.stream({
  max_tokens: 128000,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Write a detailed analysis..." }],
  model: "claude-opus-4-6"
});

const message = await stream.finalMessage();
const textBlock = message.content.find((block) => block.type === "text");
if (textBlock && textBlock.type === "text") {
  console.log(textBlock.text);
}
```

The `.stream()` call keeps the HTTP connection alive with server-sent events, then `.get_final_message()` (Python) or `.finalMessage()` (TypeScript) accumulates all events and returns the complete `Message` object. In Go, you call `message.Accumulate(event)` inside the stream loop to build the same complete `Message`. In Java, use `MessageAccumulator.create()` and call `accumulator.accumulate(event)` on each event. In Ruby, call `.accumulated_message` on the stream.

## Event types

Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event uses an SSE event name (e.g. `event: message_stop`), and includes the matching event `type` in its data.

Each stream uses the following event flow:

1. `message_start`: contains a `Message` object with empty `content`.
2. A series of content blocks, each of which have a `content_block_start`, one or more `content_block_delta` events, and a `content_block_stop` event. Each content block has an `index` that corresponds to its index in the final Message `content` array.
3. One or more `message_delta` events, indicating top-level changes to the final `Message` object.
4. A final `message_stop` event.

> **Warning:** The token counts shown in the `usage` field of the `message_delta` event are *cumulative*.

### Ping events

Event streams may also include any number of `ping` events.

### Error events

The API may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an `overloaded_error`, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:

```sse
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

### Other events

In accordance with the versioning policy, new event types may be added, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.

## Content block delta types

Each `content_block_delta` event contains a `delta` of a type that updates the `content` block at a given `index`.

### Text delta

A `text` content block delta looks like:

```sse
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

### Input JSON delta

The deltas for `tool_use` content blocks correspond to updates for the `input` field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are _partial JSON strings_, whereas the final `tool_use.input` is always an _object_.

You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a `content_block_stop` event, by using a library like [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json/#partial-json-parsing) to do partial JSON parsing, or by using the SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.

A `tool_use` content block delta looks like:

```sse
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}
```

Note: Current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from `input` at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working.

### Thinking delta

When using extended thinking with streaming enabled, you'll receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events. These deltas correspond to the `thinking` field of the `thinking` content blocks.

For thinking content, a special `signature_delta` event is sent just before the `content_block_stop` event. This signature is used to verify the integrity of the thinking block.

When `display: "omitted"` is set on the thinking configuration, no `thinking_delta` events are sent.

A typical thinking delta looks like:

```sse
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "thinking_delta", "thinking": "I need to find the GCD of 1071 and 462 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1071 = 2 * 462 + 147"}}
```

The signature delta looks like:

```sse
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "signature_delta", "signature": "EqQBCgIYAhIM1gbcDa9GJwZA2b3hGgxBdjrkzLoky3dl1pkiMOYds..."}}
```

## Full HTTP Stream response

A stream response is comprised of:
1. A `message_start` event
2. Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
    - A `content_block_start` event
    - Potentially multiple `content_block_delta` events
    - A `content_block_stop` event
3. A `message_delta` event
4. A `message_stop` event

There may be `ping` events dispersed throughout the response as well.

### Basic streaming request

```bash Shell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --data \
'{
  "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
  "max_tokens": 256,
  "stream": true
}'
```

```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    max_tokens=256,
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();

const stream = client.messages.stream({
  model: "claude-opus-4-6",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
  max_tokens: 256
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === "content_block_delta" && event.delta.type === "text_delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta.text);
  }
}
```

Example response:

```sse
event: message_start
data: {"type": "message_start", "message": {"id": "msg_1nZdL29xx5MUA1yADyHTEsnR8uuvGzszyY", "type": "message", "role": "assistant", "content": [], "model": "claude-opus-4-6", "stop_reason": null, "stop_sequence": null, "usage": {"input_tokens": 25, "output_tokens": 1}}}

event: content_block_start
data: {"type": "content_block_start", "index": 0, "content_block": {"type": "text", "text": ""}}

event: ping
data: {"type": "ping"}

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "Hello"}}

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta", "index": 0, "delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "!"}}

event: content_block_stop
data: {"type": "content_block_stop", "index": 0}

event: message_delta
data: {"type": "message_delta", "delta": {"stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence":null}, "usage": {"output_tokens": 15}}

event: message_stop
data: {"type": "message_stop"}
```

### Streaming request with tool use

> Tool use supports fine-grained streaming for parameter values. Enable it per tool with `eager_input_streaming`.

```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

tools = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"],
        },
    }
]

with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice={"type": "any"},
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in San Francisco?"}
    ],
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
```

### Streaming request with extended thinking

```python Python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=20000,
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 16000},
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the greatest common divisor of 1071 and 462?",
        }
    ],
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "content_block_delta":
            if event.delta.type == "thinking_delta":
                print(event.delta.thinking, end="", flush=True)
            elif event.delta.type == "text_delta":
                print(event.delta.text, end="", flush=True)
```

## Error recovery

### Claude 4.5 and earlier

For Claude 4.5 models and earlier, you can recover a streaming request that was interrupted due to network issues, timeouts, or other errors by resuming from where the stream was interrupted. This approach saves you from re-processing the entire response.

The basic recovery strategy involves:

1. **Capture the partial response**: Save all content that was successfully received before the error occurred
2. **Construct a continuation request**: Create a new API request that includes the partial assistant response as the beginning of a new assistant message
3. **Resume streaming**: Continue receiving the rest of the response from where it was interrupted

### Claude 4.6

For Claude 4.6 models, you should add a user message that instructs the model to continue from where it left off. For example:

```text
Your previous response was interrupted and ended with [previous_response]. Continue from where you left off.
```

### Error recovery best practices

1. **Use SDK features**: Leverage the SDK's built-in message accumulation and error handling capabilities
2. **Handle content types**: Be aware that messages can contain multiple content blocks (`text`, `tool_use`, `thinking`). Tool use and extended thinking blocks cannot be partially recovered. You can resume streaming from the most recent text block.
